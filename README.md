# GIT project

### In this project I am familiarizing myself with the basics of using git. come along as you learn with me

first of all, what is git?

In my understanding, git is a very powerful **distributed** version control system. 

As a distributed system redundancies is controlled and collaboration between developers is seamless.

To be able to use git it must be installed on your computer either a Windows, Mac, or Linux system.

First of all, I created a local working directory named **Devops** using ***mkdir*** 

afterward, I changed my working directory to the new directory I created using the ***cd Devops*** command as seen in the image below.
